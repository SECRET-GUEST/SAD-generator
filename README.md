It's a very basic **python form** who could be helpful to start with **python** and
**tkinter**. 
Inside you can find how to make you own and customizable **pop up window** (**icon**, ...)
but also **how to return variable from entry** and similar things like
**how to make a class**, **customize fonts in tkinter**, all the very basic.

But it's obviously keywords s**t , it's just a `dank sad generator` but fun *=)* .

## OMG WHY THE .EXE VERSION IS A MALWARE FOR MOST OF ANTIVIRUS ? OMG

It's a non-signed software, free. You have the script, you can compile it
by yourself if you want ;

```

Here a tutorial explaning different ways to run the files :


# For **MAC** & **Linux** users :

Since this script is designed for Windows users, you should probably first improve the code.

However here is the procedure to run the script:

* [ MAC ] ; https://macosx-faq.com/how-to-run-python-script/
* [ LINUX ] ; open a terminal then cd until the script and type

```
python script.pyw
```
(where "script.pyw" is obviously the name of what you've downloaded)


# For microsoft users;

Because this script is made by pyinstaller it could be detected as a malware.

Here are possibilities to run the script; 

## 1. Run by simple click on APPLICATION.exe

The .exe file is a portable version made for microsoft users with pyinstaller, you can download only this file and nothing else.


## 2. Run with Python

"Python script" is directory with the original script for python 3.11. 

In case you have a lower version you may have to download module imported not included with your version. 
Just read the first lines of the script in Alexandria with a notepad or whatever to find what's missing.

If you would like to run with python **YOU WILL NEED THE IMAGE .png PLACED IN THE SAME DIRECTORY OF THE RUNNING SCRIPT**.

Also you can add a w to the extension (like "script.pyw"). It means "windowed mode", to launch the python script without the CMD but it's still a common python file.


## 3. Compile the script by yourself 

### Instructions 

To create your own executable from the python file, you will need to install pyinstaller and python. 

Here are the steps you should follow:

* Download python 3.11.1

Don't forget to add it to your path with the installer or in variables environment ( so reboot your PC after the installation ), here is the link : https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.1/python-3.11.1-amd64.exe

* Open your CMD as an administrator and type the following command:

```
python -m pip install pyinstaller
```

* Once the installation is complete, type the following command in your cmd window, replacing the file paths with your own:

```
pyinstaller --onefile --icon="...YOUR PATH.../YOUR ICON.ico" --add-data "...YOUR PATH.../ico;ico" --noconsole test.py

```

Here are the explanations of the different options:

- [ ] --onefile

 creates a single executable that includes all dependencies.

- [ ] --icon=icon.ico

specifies the icon to use for the executable (replace icon.ico with the path to your icon file).

- [ ] --add-data "path/to/file;folder_name"

adds external files required by the program. The path to the file and the name of the folder in which the file will be extracted should be separated by a semicolon (;). You can add multiple files by separating them with semicolons.

- [ ] script.py

specifies the name of your Python script.

- [ ] --noconsole

hides the console when the executable is run.


Make sure to replace the snipped parts with the names of your files and folders. Also note that the path should be specified based on the operating system you are working on.

After running this command, you should have a single executable that includes all dependencies, external files, and a custom icon, and does not show the console when running.

Alternatively you can also :

## 4. Create a batch file to run 

- [ ] Create a text file

- [ ] In the text file type and write (and change/ complete the path, first is for python, 2nd is for layer1.py);

```
C:\YOUR PATH TO PYTHON \python.exe" "C:\ **YOUR PATH TO THE SCRIPT** \layer1.pyw"
```

If Python is in path, you can just ; 

```
python "C:\ **YOUR PATH TO THE SCRIPT** \layer1.pyw"
```

- [ ] Rename the "new_file.txt" by "layer1.bat" then just click on and it will run the program.
