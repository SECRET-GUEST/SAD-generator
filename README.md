It's a very basic **python form** who could be helpful to start with **python** and
**tkinter**. 
Inside you can find how to make you own and customizable **pop up window** (**icon**, ...)
but also **how to return variable from entry** and similar things like
**how to make a class**, **customize fonts in tkinter**, all the very basic.

But it's obviously keywords s**t , it's just a `dank sad generator` but fun *=)* .

Read the script for more.
