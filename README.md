This script has been written in python to be compiled with auto-py-to-exe.
You have to download it if you want to make the exe by yourself, here is the link ;
https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/

All you need to know to make the script work is in sad.py but to help you a little bit
here is something you need to know ;

Auto-py is bugged so to make it works I had to put a function then change all paths
and rename it into the function. As I wrote ; all is in the script.
