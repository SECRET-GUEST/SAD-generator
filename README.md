It's a very basic **python form** who could be helpful to start with **python** and
**tkinter**. 
Inside you can find how to make you own and customizable **pop up window** (**icon**, ...)
but also **how to return variable from entry** and similar things like
**how to make a class**, **customize fonts in tkinter**, all the very basic.

But it's obviously keywords s**t , it's just a `dank sad generator` but fun *=)* .

## OMG WHY THE .EXE VERSION IS A MALWARE FOR MOST OF ANTIVIRUS ? OMG

It's a non-signed software, free. You have the script, you can compile it
by yourself if you want ;

This tutorial is made for absolute beginners

# For **MAC** & **Linux** users :

Since this script is designed for Windows users, you should probably first improve the code.

However here is the procedure to run the script:

* [ MAC ] ; https://macosx-faq.com/how-to-run-python-script/
* [ LINUX ] ; open a terminal then navigate until the script and type

```
python SCRIPT_NAME.pyw
```

# For microsoft users;

Because this script has no official signature it could be detected as a malware so I made 3 versions to show you it's safu (for transparency).

Here are possibilities to run the script; 

## 1. Run by simple click on SCRIPT_NAME.exe

The first .exe file is a portable version made for windows 10 with auto-py-to-exe, you can download only this file and nothing else.

## 2. Run with Python

"Python script" is directory with the original script for python 3.10.

In case you have a lower version you may have to download module imported not included with your version. 
Just read the first lines of the script in Alexandria with a notepad to find what modules are missing.

If you would like to run with python **YOU WILL NEED THE ICON FOLDER PLACED IN THE SAME DIRECTORY OF THE RUNNING SCRIPT**.

Also I made 2 versions, all is described in the name but here's a reminder ;

- One prepared to be compiled with auto-py-to-exe who can't run solo (all is explained in the script).
- "SCRIPT_NAME.py" ready to launch.

## 3. Compile yourself the python script ;

**THIS IS A TUTORIAL FOR ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS**

- [ ] 0. Download the python script, and the icon folder.

- [ ] 1.a Download and install python here ; https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/python-3.11.0-amd64.exe

DON'T FORGET TO TICK THE BOX " ADD PYTHON TO PATH " (or do it with variable environment on your pc)

- [ ] 1.b You can finalize this tutorial by right-clicking on SCRIPT_NAME.py and select open with python, but you can also ; 

- [ ] 2. Compile the file yourself

Now you will need auto-py-to-exe, here is the link https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/#description

You just have to click on the autopytoexe.py after the download and follow instructions, don't forget to add sad.png by tick additionnal files or it will not work.

Also you can obviously compile it from another way but I suppose auto-py-to-exe is the fastest and easiest way.

Here is an example of how to compile the script with auto-py-to-exe  : 

Run this command in the cmd 

```
autopytoexe
```

And then complete as you  prefere : 

![auto py](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92639080/215331495-60d5ec54-6e7c-482c-8cf4-40b4fce34372.jpg)


Alternatively you can also :

## 4. Create a batch file to run 

- [ ] 1. Create a text file

- [ ] 2. In the text file type and write (and change/ complete the path, first is for python, 2nd is for SCRIPT_NAME.py);

```
C:\YOUR PATH TO PYTHON \python.exe" "C:\ **YOUR PATH TO THE SCRIPT** \SCRIPT_NAME.pyw"
```

If Python is in path, you can just ; 

```
python "C:\ **YOUR PATH TO THE SCRIPT** \SCRIPT_NAME.pyw"
```

- [ ] 3. Rename the "new_file.txt" by "SCRIPT_NAME.bat" then just click on and it will run the program.

If these steps are not working, before smashing your screen with your keyboard, you maybe wants to take a look in the noobugs.

```
_  _ ____ ____ ___  _  _ ____ ____ 
|\ | |  | |  | |__] |  | | __ [__  
| \| |__| |__| |__] |__| |__] ___] 
 ``` 
 
 
1. To rename in .bat, you have to verify if you can;
You just have to open any file you want (Document or whatever) then go to display upside of the searchbar then tick the box asking you if you want to see the filename extension

![tuto](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92639080/199935818-8d4f9bcf-5eb0-4a0d-9cd5-1eeb11182880.png)

Or you can check other possibilities to get it here ; https://www.wikihow.com/Change-a-File-Extension


2. Make sure you replaced the python path by yours, path where you nstalled python without forget the Python.exe in the end.
```
"C:\Users\ **YOUR USER NAME** \AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe"
```
Again for the path of the script
```
"C:\Users\ **YOUR USER NAME** \Desktop\sad.py"
```
3. If it's still not running in .bat, it's possibly because you don't have installed libraries to run the script.

4. Or because you forgot to add the .png in the same folder of the script.
