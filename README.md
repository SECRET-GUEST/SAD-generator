This script has been written in **python** to be compiled with **auto-py-to-exe**.
You have to download it if you want to make the exe by yourself, here is the link ;

https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/

`The .exe file is portable btw ; you can move it everywhere you want without shortcut`

All you need to know to make the script work is in sad.py but to help you a little bit
here is something you need to know ;

Auto-py is bugged so to make it works I had to put a function then change all paths
and rename it into the function. As I wrote ; all is in the script.

```

```

It's a very basic **python form** who could be helpful to start with **python** and
**tkinter**. 
Inside you can find how to make you own and customizable **pop up window** (**icon**, ...)
but also **how to return variable from entry** and similar things like
**how to make a class**, **customize fonts in tkinter**, all the very basic.

But I obviously wrote that for keywords, it's just a 	`dank sad generator` *:3* .
